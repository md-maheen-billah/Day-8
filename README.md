# Day 8 (Duration: 6 Months)
Today's learning included working on the 'G3 Architects' project. I set up Google Fonts, added banner content with styles, ensuring responsiveness for mobile and medium devices. Additionally, I structured the Teams section using Flex and Grid layout, making it responsive and using shared CSS classes. I extended this approach to the Facts and Sponsors sections, implementing flexibility with Flex. Lastly, I created content for the Features section and incorporated badges.
